# Week 3: </br>
**Numpy Exercise:**  This NumPy exercise covers installation, importing, array creation, indexing, slicing, sorting, searching, and joining arrays. Key skills include data manipulation, sorting, filtering, and reshaping. </br>

**MatplotLib Exercise:**  This Matplotlib exercise covers installation, importing, barcharts, histogram, piecharts, sine waves, lines, labels, grid lines, scatterplot, 3d scatterplots, 3d bar graphs.</br>

**Seaborn Exercise:**  This Seaborn exercise covers installation, viewing data, loading datasets, pairplots, boxplots, violin plots, histograms, swarm plots, bar plots, and heatmaps. </br>

# Week 4: </br>
**Linear Regression ML Model:** This simple model was trained to identify Salary based on Years of Experience given a simple training dataset. Model uses linear regression, and splits data into 80/20 training/testing sets.

# Week 5: </br>
**Logistic ML Model:** A classification model to help make predictions to assist doctors and healthcare providers in diagnosis of potential heart disease. Model predicts which patients are most likely to suffer from a heart disease in the near future using the features given.

# Week 7: <br/>
**Naive Bayes ML Model:** A classification model to help make predictions to assist in the diagnosis of Diabetes. Model predicts which patients are most likely to have Diabetes given parameters on their health. Naive Bayes models generally have lower accuracy, given that they assume feature independence (hence, Naive) but can still be useful in certain diagnostic contexts. 

# Week 8: <br/>
**Decision Tree ML Model:** A decision tree is a model that splits data into branches based on feature conditions, helping to classify or predict outcomes. It visually shows the decision-making process, revealing how different attributes influence the final result. This model predicts likelihood of loan repayment given information about the individual's habits/credit history.

# Week 9: <br/>
**Neural Network ML Model:** A neural network consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons that transform input data into learned patterns. By adjusting weights through iterative training, this kind of model excels in many tasks - like classification, regression, and generation. Here, a neural network was created to predict Customer Churn - whether a customer is likely to leave a service. This enables businesses to take preventative actions in order to retain their customer.

# Project:  Predicting Crop Yields via Decision Tree
**Decision Tree ML Model:** A decision tree was implemented to predict crop yield given historical agricultural data, including region, rainfall, and temperatures.
